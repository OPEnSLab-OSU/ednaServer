**Scenario**
Describe the "issue" from the perspective of a client

**Reminders**
- Don't merge any branches associated with creating scenarios or solving scenarios
- Scouts honor - don't compare the scenario branch from main code to solve the problem or old commits as much as possible. 
  - The goal is to learn the codebase by debugging and writing code, just like you would a real problem.
